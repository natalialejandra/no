  Police brutality is a pressing issue that’s lingered for centuries. Abuse of power, an inflated sense of self that roots itself on a badge and a title. In recent years, the issue has only gotten worse, and due to countless high-profile cases, it has gained more attention from society. Consequently, people have called out the need for police reform and demanded it through protests and demonstrations across the country. 
</p>
<p>
  One of the most high-profile cases of this century have been that of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, who was fatally shot in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment in March 2020, victim to an investigation into drug dealing operations that she was in no way linked to. A website created after the fact called <a href="https://www.standwithbre.com/">Stand with Bre</a> revealed that “the officers responsible were not only at the wrong home, in the wrong apartment complex, and in the wrong neighborhood, the man they were looking for had already been arrested by their department early that day.”

  Then , the murder of George Floyd, a name that became known and heard throughout the whole country, taking over the internet and sparking widespread outrage. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May 2020, a black man called George Floyd was murdered by a police officer who kneeled on his neck despite Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe. 
</p>
<p>
  After the internet got a hold of a video circulating of the incident, outrage, and disgust was felt throughout the country. The officer responsible for Floyd's death was later charged and found guilty of murder, but the incident sparked a broader conversation about the need for police reform and the systemic racism that underlies police brutality. 
</p>
<p>
  Six years prior to the George Floyd case, in July 2014, a man called Eric Garner was held in a chokehold by an NYPD police officer over selling untaxed cigarettes. The officer ignored Garner when he repeatedly said “I can’t breathe.” Garner suffered a fatal asthma attack due to the officer’s chokehold. These are two of countless cases where the victims pleaded that they couldn’t breathe: Byron Williams died telling police he couldn’t breathe on September 5th, 2019, Fermin Vincent Valenzuela died of asphyxiation at the hands of police in 2016, Hector Arreola died telling police he couldn’t breathe in 2017, the list goes on. 
  A movement was then born: #ICantBreathe.

  <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/crime-law-and-justice/police-killing-of-amir-locke">Amir Locke</a> was killed at 22 years old during a no-knock warrant for a crime that he had no involvement in. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/andre-hill-shot-times-columbus-police-officer-autopsy/story?id=76724709">Andre Hill</a> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/adam-coy-columbus-murder-andre-hill.html">killed</a> at 47 years old, unarmed and non-threatening, he was shot 4 times. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/atatiana-jefferson-aaron-dean-trial-b2239414.html">Atatiana Jefferson</a> was 28 years old and in her home with her then 8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr, who was later called in to testify at 11 years old. More recently in 2023, a mere 7 days into the year, a 29-year-old father to a 4-year-old, Tyre Nichols was beaten by police, which lead to his death three days later. Nichols died on January 10th from blunt force trauma to the head after being repeatedly punched, kicked, and pepper sprayed by five Memphis Police Department officers on January 7, 2023. He was allegedly pulled over for “reckless driving” but documents show the officers never communicated this to Nichols, according to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/08/memphis-cops-never-told-tyre-nichols-why-he-was-pulled-over/">New York Post article</a> on the incident. The list goes on. These cases are just a few examples of the many instances where police abused their power in recent years, the same police officers that are tasked with keeping communities safe. These cases of excessive force and violence have worn down the trust between law enforcement and the communities they're supposed to serve. Many activists and advocates have called for changes to police training and accountability, as many of these victims' perpetrators are let off unpunished. According to data, in approximately 9,980 of 11,469 cases, no charges have been known to be filed, and around 34 cases were acquitted, meaning the officers involved were absolved of blame and free of charges, after having been found guilty.

    Years of cases have proven police to be quick to use deadly force, this has opened the floor for varying opinions. Some people argue that officers should be able to protect themselves as well as their communities and that to achieve this they should be provided better training and support, especially for cases in which they’ll deal with people with mental issues and/or from marginalized communities. Others have demanded police departments get defunded, calling for the reallocation of the funds that go towards what many argue to be a broken system. Nevertheless, regardless of the conversations that have sparked from these incidents, little to no reform has occurred, why is that? 
</p>
<p>
    I spoke with Sariely Rosado Fernández, who was a Superior Court Judge for Aggravated Felonies in Puerto Rico from 2014 up until just a week ago, 2023, when she decided to step down because of issues she went on to speak about. Rosado feels both judicial and police departments are underfunded, and consequently lack proper training and protection. She goes on to say that a lot of cases she’s had to handle or has seen, more often than not root in the fact that the officer involved thought “I have to kill them before they kill me,” when faced with a person they believe to be a threat. Rosario argues that defunding the police would only make matters worse, as what she feels they need is more funding to receive better training and better equipment like bulletproof vests, which she claims, at least in the cases she’s seen, don’t do a proper job at protecting those who wear them and for this reason, officers act rasher and more violent. 
</p>
<p>
    She comments “The solution cannot lie in saying ‘let’s eliminate the police’ or taking away funding. The solution is in how we work to better the police force, and what we're going to do to have police we feel are actually there to combat crime and prevent it as well because they aren’t just there to fight and give out punches but to prevent, educate and to assist citizens.” For this reason, she finishes by saying “Therefore, in no way would I ever suggest that defunding the police is the solution, I’d give them more funds and I’d restructure the system and police force as we know it.” From the perspective of the former Judge, the road to reform could potentially start with providing the police force with the aid and means to get access to better training, as they should have the proper tools to know how to react in high-risk situations. Because in an altercation between two people, the one trained to handle a situation like this one should have the knowledge and proper skills to be able to calm down a person who isn’t trained to know how to react when being detained. Often, these cases are a result of situations escalating due to stress, fear, and/or a triggered fight or flight response on both sides. Rosado argues that there are ways to fix this.

  I spoke with Valeria Aponte Feliciano, 4-time Emmy winner reporter for NBC Telemundo Philadelphia, who has reported on the matter before; she advised me to “not only present opinions but also official reports and statements made by authorities on the matter.” Aponte informed me many states have taken strides toward police reform. Philadelphia, for instance, had their City Council approve the <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/philadelphia-city-council-approves-driving-equality-bill-banning-traffic-stops-for-minor-violations">Driving Equality Bill</a> banning traffic stops for minor violations, which could aid in preventing cases like that of Tyre Nichols escalate or happen at all. But with every step forward, other states take a couple of steps back. Congress, reportedly, plans to overturn the <a href="https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/acts/24-781">Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act</a>, passed just last year, which aims to “improve police accountability and transparency.”

<p>
Though awareness alone can do a lot, a system so deeply and fundamentally flawed requires more push to shift the balance of a power hierarchy. How do we know not a lot has changed? This year, 2023, by February there were 14 more deaths than there were the same time the previous year, in trend with the consistent number of deaths each year, showing no decrease or anomaly.

  Recent cases of police brutality have brought this long-standing issue to the forefront of public consciousness. While progress has been made in some areas, there is still much work to be done to address systemic racism and reform policing practices. It is essential to continue to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions and to work towards a more just and equitable society. With ongoing efforts to address these issues, we can hope to see a future where everyone feels safe and protected by law enforcement, and not scared or intimidated by it.
